  <h1>Privacy Policy for Nocterms</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 21, 2025</p>

  <p>At Nocterms, we believe users deserve clarity not just in Terms of Service, but in privacy too. Thatâ€™s why we collect as little data as possible â€” and never sell it.</p>

  <h2>What We Collect</h2>

  <h3>1. Email Address</h3>
  <p>We collect your email address <strong>only if you choose to create an account</strong> or use features that require authentication.</p>

  <h3>2. User Type (Optional)</h3>
  <p>When signing up or onboarding, you may optionally tell us what kind of user you are (e.g. artist, smart shopper, parent, freelancer, etc.). This helps us tailor the alerts you see, but itâ€™s completely voluntary. You can skip it or change it later.</p>

  <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <p>We use your email and user type to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide access to your account</li>
    <li>Personalize the Terms &amp; Conditions analysis shown to you</li>
    <li>Improve your experience by showing the most relevant information</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We <strong>do not</strong>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sell your data</li>
    <li>Share it with third-party advertisers</li>
    <li>Use it for tracking across other websites</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Storage &amp; Security</h2>
  <p>Your data is stored securely using Supabase, a trusted cloud service provider. We follow modern best practices to protect your information from unauthorized access.</p>

  <h2>Your Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can use most of Nocterms without sharing your user type.</li>
    <li>You can delete your account or request your data to be removed at any time â€” just email us at <a href="mailto:nocterms@gmail.com">nocterms@gmail.com</a>.</li>
  </ul>
